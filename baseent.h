	// every frame the program will have to dynamically create and destroy objects a whole lot.
	// SOLUTION: There is a stack of each type of entity and rule . When an entity or rule
	// is needed it checks if there is one on the stack. If so, it pulls it off and runs it's
	// "constructor". If there isn't one available, it creates it, and then calls it's "constructor".
